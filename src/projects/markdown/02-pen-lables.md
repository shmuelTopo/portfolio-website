I developed Pen Label Generator, for a company in Lakewood, a software tool built using JavaScript, Svelte, and Tauri â€”a lighter alternative to Electron. designed to automate the time-consuming process of creating labels for pens stand.

### Here are the software's key features:

1. Label customization: Users can adjust the font size and customize the name of each pen label, according to their preferences.
2. Cart management: The software allows users to conveniently add or remove pens from the cart, ensuring flexibility in label generation.
3. Image selection: Users have the option to choose which images to display for each pen, providing visual customization.
