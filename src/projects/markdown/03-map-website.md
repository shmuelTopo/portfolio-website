I developed a web app that combines **Google Maps** with **Wikipedia** data. Users can search for a topic, view markers on a map for relevant locations, and click for detailed information.

### Here are the website's key features:

1. Integration: Wikimap combines Google Maps and Wikipedia, enabling users to search for topics and view markers on a map for relevant locations.
2. Interactive location browsing: Users can click on a marker in Wikimap to open a Wikipedia link providing detailed information about the selected location.
3. JavaScript and jQuery implementation: Wikimap utilizes JavaScript and jQuery to make Ajax calls to the Wikipedia API and Google Maps API, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
